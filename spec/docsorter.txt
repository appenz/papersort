Document sorting is done in the class DocSorter
- Create it in a new directory, docsorter
- the class has an init functionality
    - It reads DOCSTORE/layout.txt and converts the layout it into a tree (using dicts)
    - Validates folder names in layout.txt:
        - Max 30 characters
        - Only alphanumeric, space, hyphen, underscore allowed
    - Handles special cases in layout:
        - "By year": Creates year-based subfolders (e.g. "2023", "2024")
        - "By company": Creates company-based subfolders
        - "Keep structure": Maintains original path structure
        - "Other": Catchall for documents without good matches

- initializer is called with a file system path to a PDF or image
    - should check if the file exists
    - validates file type is PDF or image
    - stores original path and filename

- The class has the following fields:
    - Title: A one line summary what the document is about
    - Year: The year of the document, for tax documents this is the Tax year
    - Entity: Who the document is from or for
    - Previous Path: The path the file is from, formatted like a Linux path
    - File Name: A valid linux file name. 
        - It should start with the date formatted as "2024-08" followed by a short, 50 letter max description
        - Same file type as the input
        - Example "2024-02 Chase Bank Monthly Account Statement.pdf"
    - A suggested path to store the file based on the layout.txt file

- Error Handling:
    - GPT API failures: Retry up to 3 times, then give up
    - Invalid path suggestions: Retry with LLM up to 3 times, then throw error
    - Layout.txt missing/malformed: Throw clear error
    - Path validation: Ensure suggested path exists in layout tree

- Populating the fields are populated using gpt-4o via the OpenAI API. We send the PDF as an image with a prompt and parse the results.
    - API key read from environment variables
    - LLM makes final decisions on:
        - Category placement
        - Company name standardization
        - Date selection
