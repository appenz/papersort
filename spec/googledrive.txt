This program can read from and write to Google Drive. This functionality is encapsulated in the class gdrive. Specifically:

1. Authentication and Setup:
- Uses the Google Python client libraries (google-api-python-client and google-auth-oauthlib)
- Local credentials should be read from the credentials.json file in the project root
- Implements OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with proper token management

2. Core Functionality:
- The gdrive class should be implemented in a dedicated module (e.g., gdrive.py)
- All methods should include proper type hints and error handling
- Constructor: __init__(credentials_path: str = "credentials.json") -> None
  * Takes an optional path to credentials file
  * Initializes Google Drive client and handles authentication

3. Directory Operations:
- list_items(path: str) -> List[Dict]: Lists contents of a directory
  * Returns a list of dictionaries containing item metadata (name, id, type, size)
  * Handles pagination for large directories

- get_item_by_path(path: str) -> Dict: Retrieves metadata for a specific item
  * Takes a path string (e.g., "Documents/Taxes/2023")
  * Returns item metadata or None if not found

- create_folder(path: str, name: str) -> Dict: Creates a new folder
  * Creates folders recursively if parent folders don't exist
  * Returns metadata of the created folder

4. File Operations:
- upload_file(local_path: str, drive_path: str) -> Dict: Uploads a file
  * Supports large files through chunked upload
  * Returns metadata of the uploaded file

- download_file(drive_path: str, local_path: str) -> None: Downloads a file
  * Downloads to specified local path

- delete_item(drive_path: str) -> None: Deletes a file or folder
  * Supports recursive deletion for folders
  * Only ever moves to Trash (no permanent deletion)

5. Error Handling:
- Implements custom exceptions for common error cases
- Handles rate limiting and quota exceeded scenarios

6. Testing Requirements:
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Tests run on the Google Drive account specified /appenz_test and clean up when done
- Tests only need to work if credentials are present
