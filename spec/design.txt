PaperSort
=========

A command line tool to sort documents into a hierarchical directory structure.

Overview:
  - INBOX: Source location with unsorted documents
  - DOCSTORE: Destination with organized folder structure
  - Both can be local directories or cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
  - Documents are analyzed by LLM to determine filing location
  - layout.txt in docstore defines the folder hierarchy
