Here are some best practices and rules you must follow:

- Use Python 3.13
- Use uv for dependency management
- Follow PEP 8: Adhere to the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 style guide for formatting
- Keep It Simple: Write simple and clear code; avoid unnecessary complexity
- Write unit tests only if asked to do so explicitly
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Keep function parameters on a single line of code unless the line gets very long
- Use docstrings only if a function is unintuitive or complex. Docstrings may never be longer than 2 lines.
